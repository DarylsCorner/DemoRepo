This is where you place a description of your repo.

By adding a README.md file, our GitHub repository is updated with a simple description. Besides adding a more detailed description, it is also a good idea to explain in what way other people on GitHub should contribute to your repository. Do you have any naming conventions, folder structure requirements, etc. These details help other contributors to prepare their local work in line with your guidelines. Besides adding these details to your README.md you can also use markdown to enhance the display of your content. You can find a quick guide to markdown here https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/

After you updated the README.md file locally, you can repeat the same procedure (with either Git or GitHub Desktop) to update the file to your GitHub repository.
